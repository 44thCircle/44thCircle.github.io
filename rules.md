1. don't touch xml files
2. don't touch yml files
3. if you change css fonts, remove old font import and add the new one. only change the first font in the font list.
4. don't delete anything without asking me (zwei) first
5. if you don't understand something, ask me. if I don't respond do it anyway and if it breaks I'll clean it up.
6. have a great day.
